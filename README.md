# CRUD-Spring
This Project is for work entry test at PT. Sarana Pactindo. This is my first time using Java Spring although it's challenging cause i had to search a lot of example and fixing bugs, but i could manage to finish it in time.
Step by Step to open this Project:
1. Create database first or just use the script from database, and then create a table name users.
2. Set up application.properties in resources folder and adjust it with your own environtment.
3. You can just run the project as it will convert all the column to the tables from the models and you can open the port 8080 for the project.

Thank you.
